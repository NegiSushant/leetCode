            A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

            Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
            If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

            You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always
            considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.


You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.



Example 1:--->>>
                Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
                Output: 2
                Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Example 2:---->>>
                Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
                Output: 5
                Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where
                the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
